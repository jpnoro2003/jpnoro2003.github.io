                        In April 2021, I represented the Dufferin Peel Catholic District School Board at the 2021
                        Virtual Skills Ontario Competition, where I placed second. For the event, I had to create a story map 
                        proposing an on-demand transit route for the city of Burlington (the prompt can be seen 
                        <a href="https://edu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=02e10a8eb9da4ad9b761ef664f944d53">here</a>). Optimizing tranist routes
                        is an increasingly important matter, as it addresses the needs of our growing population while reducing emissions.<br><br>
                        
                        During this event, I applied my skills in ArcGIS, data analysis and data visualization to propose my solution to a panel of industry
                        experts. In my final deliverable, I presented my workflow and conclusions alongside maps highlighting features such as 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The proposed route with pick-up hubs</li>
                        <li>Areas where the senior population is over 25%</li>
                        <li>Areas where there is low ridership and a senior population over 25%</li>
                        <li>Population Density</li>
                        <li>Bus stops with low ridership and major roads.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Halfway through the competition, we were given time to show our work to the judges and receive feedback. I was 
                        able to implement their suggestions into my final deliverable, improving the quality of my proposal.<br><br>
                        
                        After the competition, my supervising teacher and I were

                        where I discussed my experience.
