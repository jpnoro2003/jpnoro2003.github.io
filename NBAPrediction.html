                    Throughout the history of the NBA, player salaries have increased due to inflation and the increased popularity of the league. Additionally, player's salaries are based on a multitude of factors,
                    including the year that they signed their contract, their team, and their statistics. As a result, two players who play similarly and have similar statistics might have vastly different contracts.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center my-1">
                    I developed a Random Forest Regression model that predicts a player's salary in the 2021-22 season based on their basic and advanced statistics (sourced from Basketball Reference), yielding a r-squared value of 0.836.
                    I used Pandas and Seaborn to clean, join and visualize the data, allowing me to determine trends in the data. I then tested 5 different models from Scikit-Learn, fine-tuning their hyperparameters, which increased the r-squared value of my model by 10%.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center my-1">
                    The model was then deployed on Streamlit, allowing users to try the model themselves without having to install python on their machines. The website allows users to search for a player and select a specific year of their career, achieved
                    by scraping player statistics from Basketball Reference using BeautifulSoup.
